issues: 

When I click on a tab, the outer aspect of the tab needs to stay highlighted as reference 
for which tab I selected. for example if I click on quest log, i need quest log to stay lit up
while im in it. 

when i am in daily ritual, I don't want quest log and aether archive summaries 
populating below just becuase i checked or unchecked a box. and the same thing 
happens when i am in the quest log tab. I noticed that something of that nature happens in each tab. 

when I click on journal it should only list current active quests, and its fine 
to list daily repeatable quests such as daily ritual, but quest log doesn't make 
sense for what it actually entails, its a redundent title and out of place. 

When clicking on the zone tab, only the nav buttons should populate or 
daily ritual, quest log, and aether archive should be separated by appropriate
stylized horizontal break lines. its too clutterd still. 

I should be able to select which quests i want to be active and give its 
level of priority for it to populate in the quest journal tab. 

It also seems as daily ritual should not even need its own tab since it 
is instantly displayed anyway, or can just be added to quest log. again I am just seeing to much
redundent behavior and context.
